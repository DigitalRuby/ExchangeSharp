Pull requests are encouraged and welcome. The more people contributing, the more features and faster this API will grow, serving everyone who uses C# and cryptocurrency.

For JSON parsing and strings, please use the ```CryptoUtility``` extension methods ```ToStringInvariant``` and ```ConvertInvariant``` for all parsing or conversion to other values. This ensures that any locale machine will have no problems parsing and converting data.
