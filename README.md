**Building**  
```
Windows: Open ExchangeSharp.sln in Visual Studio and build/run  
Other Platforms: dotnet build ExchangeSharp.sln -f netcoreapp2.0
Ubuntu Release Example: dotnet build ExchangeSharp.sln -f netcoreapp2.0 -c Release -r ubuntu.16.10-x64
```

Simple example:
---
```
ExchangeKrakenAPI api = new ExchangeKrakenAPI();
ExchangeTicker ticker = api.GetTicker("XXBTZUSD");
Console.WriteLine("On the Kraken exchange, 1 bitcoin is worth {0} USD.", ticker.Bid);

// load API keys created from ExchangeSharpConsole.exe keys mode=create path=keys.bin keylist=public_key,private_key
api.LoadAPIKeys("keys.bin");

/// place limit order for 0.01 bitcoin at ticker.Ask USD
ExchangeOrderResult result = api.PlaceOrder(new ExchangeOrderRequest
{
    Amount = 0.01m,
    IsBuy = true,
    Price = ticker.Ask,
    Symbol = "XXBTZUSD"
});

// Kraken is a bit funny in that they don't return the order details in the initial request, so you have to follow up with an order details request
//  if you want to know more info about the order - most other exchanges don't return until they have the order details for you.
// I've also found that Kraken tends to fail if you follow up too quickly with an order details request, so sleep a bit to give them time to get
//  their house in order.
System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(500);
result = api.GetOrderDetails(result.OrderId);

Console.WriteLine("Placed an order on Kraken for 0.01 bitcoin at {0} USD. Status is {1}. Order id is {2}.", ticker.Ask, result.Result, result.OrderId);
```

---
Web socket example:
---
```
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    // create a web socket connection to Binance. Note you can Dispose the socket anytime to shut it down.
    // the web socket will handle disconnects and attempt to re-connect automatically.
    ExchangeBinanceAPI b = new ExchangeBinanceAPI();
    using (var socket = b.GetTickersWebSocket((tickers) =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine("{0} tickers, first: {1}", tickers.Count, tickers.First());
    }))
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Press ENTER to shutdown.");
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```
