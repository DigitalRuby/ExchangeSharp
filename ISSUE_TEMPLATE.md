Be advised that I don't have time to personally answer all questions or fix every little bug at this point. Best way to get a fix is to fork the code, code up the bug fix and submit a pull request. The community is getting very active and is helpful with questions.

You can donate to get fast response time for questions and bug fixes.

Thank you.

Jeff
